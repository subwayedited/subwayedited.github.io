Battle Tree Damage Calculator
=======================

This is forked from Honko's official Pok√©mon Showdown damage calculator (http://pokemonshowdown.com/damagecalc/) by turskain.

Some of the code for the changes made were adaptations from Trainer Tower's damage calculator (https://trainertower.com/damagecalc/) made by Jake White, and cant say's/LegoFigure11's damage calculator based off of it (https://cantsay.github.io).
